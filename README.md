### Wireframes

<img src="/assets/images/image-1.png" height="300px">  <img src="/assets/images/image-2.png" height="300px">

The colour scheme chosen for the canvas and background must contrast. I want the canvas to be brighter than the background. 
There are three buttons required; How to play, play and leaderboard, which are arranged linearly and equally spread across the screen horizontally. Below these are the score counter and 30 second timer.
The Canvas fills a large propoertion of the screen to maximise visibility and difficulty.
